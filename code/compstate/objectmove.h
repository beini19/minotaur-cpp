/**
 * This class moves the robot directly, through a delegate Procedure object,
 * and performs naive movement of the object with the robot. This procedure
 * will attempt to move the robot in a certain direction to push the object
 * in that direction, while maintaining the robot's alignment with the object.
 *
 * This procedure may stop with various stop conditions that indicate whether
 * the procedure failed or reached its target. OKAY is the running value,
 * AT_TARGET indicates that the ObjectMove has pushed the object past its target
 * value, EXCEEDED_NORM means that object's alignment to its rectangular movement
 * line has exceeded a value and needs to be corrected, and WRONG_SIDE means the
 * robot has moved too far beyond the object, and needs another ReadyMove.
 *
 * Creators of this object pass a direction, target value, normal base value,
 * and normal deviation value. The target value is the desired x or y value
 * of the object, where the direction is the move direction. For instance
 * nrg::dir::RIGHT and target = 50 means move right until x >= 50.
 *
 * The normal base value and normal deviation values are to ensure alignment of
 * the object. If the object is moving in the x-direction, normal base value
 * is the initial y-value, and normal deviation is the maximum difference to this.
